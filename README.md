# Rototip Inventory Management Real World Case

## Â Overview

You are tasked with building a web application for a retail store owner to manage their inventory. This real-world case study aims to assess your technical and analytical abilities, as well as your understanding of business requirements.

  - You may use any charting library or framework of your choice.
  - Bonus: Animations, responsive design, and interactive features.

  - Bonus: Form validation and error handling.

### Technical Expectations

- Focus on demonstrating a solid understanding of the technologies you choose to use.
- You may use any framework or library, but we suggest Next.js with popular ORMs and UI libraries, as it aligns with our tech stack.
